# GameOfLife
Interactive Graphical User Interface Implementation of the popular Game of Life by John Horton Conway

Implements multithreading and the direct drawing to Panels to facilitate performance at larger board sizes.

Controls:

Mouse Wheel held down: Scroll the view of the playing board
Mouse Scroll Up/Down: Zoom in/out view of the playing board  
Left/Right Arrow Keys: decrease/increase simulation speed
Spacebar: pause/resume simulation
R: clear the board of all cells
Escape: Terminate the program

For ease of use, the following hotkeys are recommended to be used while the simulation is paused.
These can be used to create familiar patterns in the Game of Life, such as "gliders" or "oscillators",
which can then be observed as they unfold. "R" Hotkey may be used to clear the field first, as to avoid
unintented interactions of the patterns with the randomly generated cells of the initial board.

Left Click: "revive" a cell that is currently dead at the location of the cursor.
Right Click: "kill" a cell that is currently alive at the location of the cursor.
